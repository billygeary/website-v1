I am always keen to hear from interested and passionate people about potential student (Masters or PhD) projects whos research interests align with my own. 

My research page details my main topics of interest and I will often have projects available relating to these. Generally, these projects will be broadly focused on using applied and quantitative methods for better managing and conserving biodiversity at various scales, using a range of field and modelling-based approaches. I work closely with land managers and policy specialists for my research, so my research also typically has an applied focus. I am always open to developing projects with potential students that fall within my research area. 

If you are interested in working together, please [**get in touch via email**](mailto:billy.geary@unimelb.edu.au) outlining:
-   Why you want to pursue further study and your relevant experience.
-   Your area of research interest and how it aligns with my research, including some rough project ideas. 

Please also check the University of Melbourne's information on [**Masters programs**](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/study-with-us/graduate-courses/environment) and [**Graduate Research**](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/how-to-apply/graduate-research) to ensure you are able to study through the University.
