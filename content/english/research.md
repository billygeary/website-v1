I have a broad range of research interests, broadly focused on using applied and quantitative appraoches for better managing and conserving biodiversity in a time of global change. This has spanned topics including fire ecology, spatial conservation planning and prioritisation, ecological forecasting, invasive species management and ecosystem modelling. While I am always open to new avenues of research, my current research brings together two related threads:

#### **1. Impacts and management of compounding threats and disturbances**

Biodiversity is under increasing pressure from a diverse range of threats and pressures which will only worsen under climate change. Our research is motivated by identifying how species and ecological communities are shaped by interacting threats, disturbances (e.g. fire, drought) and ecological processes (e.g. predation, herbivory), and how this knowledge can be used to improve conservation outcomes for species and ecosystems. We have projects at the local-sale (e.g. in south-west and south-eastern Australia) and the continental-scale exploring this topic.

#### **2. Development and application of quantitative decision-support approaches and tools**

Stemming from my experience working in Government, we also focus on the development and application of quantitative decision-support tools. We do this by bringing together spatial conservation planning tools, expert elicitation and decision-science to help managers make sense of complex ecological decisions.
