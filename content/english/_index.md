I am an applied, quantitative ecologist interested in a range of topics, focused on better understanding how to manage biodiversity in a time of global change.

I recently started as Lecturer in Quantitative Ecology & Biodiversity Conservation at The University of Melbourne, based in the [School of Agriculture, Food and Ecosystem Sciences](http://safes.unimelb.edu.au) and the [Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group](http://qaeco.com). I am also part of the [Melbourne Biodiversity Institute](https://biodiversity.unimelb.edu.au). Previously, I graduated with my PhD from Deakin University's [Centre for Integrative Ecology](https://www.deakin.edu.au/cie) in October 2023, and worked for almost a decade in ecological policy and research for the Victorian Government.

I'm really excited to develop new collaborations and student projects, so please get in touch if you are interested!
